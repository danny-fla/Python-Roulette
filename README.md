# Python Roulette

This is a command-line Roulette game implemented in Python. The game simulates a roulette wheel and allows players to place bets on various outcomes, such as colours (Red or Black), odd or even numbers and specific numbers (Straight bets). Players can choose their desired bet type, place bet amount within range and spin the roulette wheel to determine the winning outcome. The game calculates the winnings based on the player's bet and displays the result.
